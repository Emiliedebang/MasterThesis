Then throughout the sprint we will use our Jira dashboard to track the stories in development until their ready for testing. Once ready usually a developer will do a handover showing what has been done. Then we are free to capture evidence of our testing either via a video or screengrabs. Finally if testing is done and meets expectations we will update the jira ticket with the evidence. If it was the final task on the Story i will usually close it and move onto another.

According to the Stack Overflow survey from 2020, the most popular languages are Rust, TypeScript, Python, Kotlin, Go, Julia, Dart, C#, Swift, and JavaScript. There is still a lot of code being written in Java and C/C++.

What is important is choosing the right programming language for the product that the team is tasked with producing as each language has its strengths.

What is also important is using an appropriate development methodology. If Agile is the most appropriate, then the team should determine which Agile framework is most suitable – it might be Scrum, or XP, or Kanban, or any of the other Agile frameworks that are available."

Testing a sprint behind the development is common bad practice and directly violates the working software principle; additionally this approach builds up technical debt and defect debt to be resolved at a later time. Instead, the sprint backlog must be shaped to enable collaborative design, development and testing of each user story within the sprint. High performing Scrum teams will also automate some of the tests within the sprint. The following simplistic process describes how collaborative sprint development can be applied.

We use Python only for scripting and would send it into the sun if it were not more or less a standard. JavaScript is only used as required as it is too sloppy, slow, and cumbersome, and poorly designed for our core products.

For instance, when I created a connector for edi between us and our vendors, we tested it side by side the conventional AR process to make sure that it works.  We also have to test via training for users.  When we rolled out our ERP, it was important to test it from the user vantage point since it doesn't matter if things work as they are intended unless the user knows how to do their processes.;Sometimes;Sometimes;Tech Lead;;I am working on many projects at once.
