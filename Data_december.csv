Test Plan

A test plan is a document that describes what to test, when to test, how to test, and who will do the tests. It also describes the testing scope and activities. The test plan includes the objectives of the tests to be run and helps control the risks. It’s a good practice to have a test plan written by an experienced person like a QA lead or manager.

2) 

Quality management plan

A quality management plan is a document that defines an acceptable level of product quality and describes how the project will achieve this level. It’s not a mandatory document, but it will help you schedule all the tasks needed to make sure that the project meets your customer’s needs and expectations. The main goal of this plan is to support project managers and help organize the process by defining roles, responsibilities, and quality standards to be achieved. Accordingly, it should include the software’s quality requirements and describe how they should be assessed.";Most of the time;Sometimes;Software developers (including Front End, Back End developers, etc.);;***** Development are looking at creating an   app for Wine Leaders that includes all necessary algorithms and data to provide users with the right wine for their needs, as well as functionality for those users to purchase wine through the app.;"Review of requirements
